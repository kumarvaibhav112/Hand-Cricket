1. Toss by both players – Decide who wins the toss using "ODD or EVEN".
2. Choose to Bat or Bowl – The toss winner decides whether to bat or bowl first.
3. Play the First Inning – Bat until you get out (guess matches computer).
4. Second Player Plays – The opponent bats next.
5. Score Comparison – If the second player's score exceeds the first, they win.
6. Game Result – Declares the winner based on scores.
